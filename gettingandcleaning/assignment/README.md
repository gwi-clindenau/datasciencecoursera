4. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Join Subject, activity names and data
6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set: "all_data"
8. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement to data set "extracted data"
9. create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject "averages"
